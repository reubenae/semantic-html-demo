# Summary

This was a simple version of a real piece of work in previous GED - https://github.intuit.com/SBG-Plugins/indirect-tax-ui/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+label%3Aged-accessibility+is%3Aclosed+author%3Ahbrown3+ - take a look and see how complicated that was!

Sometimes, writing semantic HTML can actually be quite hard. Strategies to help?
1. Test with a screen reader. Is it working?
2. Sketch out your HTML structure before you start - combine this with TDD
3. Don't be afraid to ask for help - see the tools and resources

# Tools & Resources
