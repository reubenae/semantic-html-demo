# Fixing our legacy code with Aria

1. contenteditable=true in code rather than in the javascript
2. Remove keyboard and mouse specific event handlers from javascript
3. Add some new attributes
- aria-labelledby
- role=label
- id's
- required=true

## Discussion

### What downsides are there of adding these attributes?

### There is a better way

Semantic HTML!
